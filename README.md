# CS-Search-Numbers
A console application that will prompt the user for a series of integers and then provide stats about the numbers provided. 

The application keeps prompting users to enter integers, one at a time. Note: For this lab, your application does not have to handle the situation when the user enters non-integers.
When the user presses the “Enter” key without entering anything at a prompter. The application displays the following:
  The maximum value of all integers entered.
  The minimum value of all integers entered.
  The total number of odd integers entered.
  The sum of all odd integers entered.
  The average value of all odd integers entered.
  The total number of event integers entered.
  The sum of all even integers entered.
  The average value of all even integers entered.
After displaying all the listed above, the application should prompt the user with the following message:
Play again (Y/y)?
If the user enters "Y" or "y", the application resets all calculations and returns to recording numbers. The application terminates if the user enters any other character(s).
